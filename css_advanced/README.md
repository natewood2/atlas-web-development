We are tasked with designing a webpage based off of the provided Figma file.





## The Goal:

The goal is to match the Figma file 1:1.

That is a pretty tall task but I gave it my best shot.

I am just glad I have two montiors at home. It makde it way easier.


## Tasks:

 - We need to follow the instructions so we can get the website visuals correct.
 - Follow the rubric.
 - Then make a awesome read me over what the project is about.


## Tools Used:

- We were giving Figma and that shows us how the webpage should be layed out.

- We used the inspect element tool heavily in this project. It was great to learn about this tool and learn how powerful this is.
