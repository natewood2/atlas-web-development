# Atlas Web Development

We are tasked with designing a webpage based off of the provided Figma file. We had to write the html and then write the CSS for our website.




## The Goal:

The goal is to match the Figma file 1:1.

That is a pretty tall task but I gave it my best shot.

I am just glad I have two montiors at home. It makde it way easier.
